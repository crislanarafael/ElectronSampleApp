# System Info App using Electron JS


I created a desktop app using Electron JS that displays my system information and packaged it as an executable for people to use.

A note on Resources: Traversy Media was a HUGE help for me to get this app running. One of the big issues I ran into was packaging the app into an executable file. I had issues installing electron-forge and electron-builder (I believe because I do not have VS Studio on my machine) so I used electron-packager instead. I was initially worried about the videos being dated a few years back (wasn't sure how much electron js has changed) but they managed to hold up pretty well. Highly recommend his channel!!!
